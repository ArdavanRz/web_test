Question 1 : used gnu 3 licence and gitingnore for C++ files. usually in game projects there is no need to add 3D objects to the repository thus, .fbx and .obj and material files are ignored.

Question 2 : we first cloen the repository. then add our test file in the directory. open bash and add the file. then commit the file. add comments and save with :x!
then we push into origin main. repeat the process for any applied changes.
