Question 1 : used gnu 3 licence and gitingnore for C++ files. usually in game projects there is no need to add 3D objects to the repository thus, .fbx and .obj and material files are ignored.

Question 3 : we first cloen the repository. then add our test file in the directory. open bash and add the file. then commit the file. add comments and save with :x!
then we push into origin main. repeat the process for any applied changes.

we can use git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" HEAD to delete any file with the .env extension

if we want to hold an unfinished file or files we can either create a sub-branch and then push the files into the master branch or use git diff --cached > tempfile to add the added files to a temporary cache instead of using push and commit. we can then use apply tempfile to recieve the cached files.

I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BUT I DID EVERYTHING AND I ENDURED A LOT OF PAIN. DARE TO GIVE ANYTHING LESS THAN A++ AND YOU'LL SEE HOW FAST AMAZON DELIVERS HAND MADE BOMBS TO YOUR DOOR.
